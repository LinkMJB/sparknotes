# sparknotes
A repository to host notes from books I have read, hopefully useful to others as well

I plan to consolidate notes I take from books I read here, as a central repository to reference. My hope is that others are able to gain benefit from my notes, when they are unable to invest the time to read these books themselves. We can't all read the exact same books, right???
